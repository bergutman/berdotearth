                    <article>
                        <p>
                            I've watched with growing concern a troubling
                            paradigm shift take hold in climate discourse: the
                            sudden rehabilitation of nuclear energy as an
                            environmentalist dark horse. Once a taboo subject,
                            nuclear power is now being framed as a misunderstood
                            savior, a necessary compromise in the desperate
                            scramble to cut emissions.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The argument goes like this: With time running out,
                            renewables alone can't possibly meet 21st-century
                            energy demands. Nuclear, we’re told, is the
                            pragmatic solution: a dense, reliable energy source
                            unfairly maligned by outdated fears. Some proponents
                            go further, painting opposition to nuclear as the
                            result of a shadowy smear campaign by oil and gas
                            interests.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            There are kernels of truth in these claims. Modern
                            reactor designs are safer than their predecessors.
                            Nuclear does offer a low-carbon alternative to
                            fossil fuels. But beneath this seductive narrative
                            lies a far more dangerous gamble that its most vocal
                            advocates downplay or ignore entirely.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Because here’s the uncomfortable reality: If someone
                            promises to solve all your problems without
                            requiring a single sacrifice, they’re not a
                            revolutionary. They’re a charlatan.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Before dissecting the logistics, we must first
                            confront a moral imperative:
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The decisions we make today regarding the widespread
                            adoption of nuclear fission will not die with us.
                            They will not even die with the children of
                            tomorrow, who will have long forgotten our ways.
                            These choices, made in service of our immediate
                            needs, will echo across timescales so vast they
                            dwarf the entirety of human history. To scale
                            nuclear energy as aggressively as some propose is to
                            permanently alter the trajectory of this planet—not
                            for decades or centuries, but for geological epochs.
                            And it will not affect us alone. Every living being
                            on Earth, present and future, inherits this legacy.

                            Nuclear fission produces byproducts. Most become
                            harmless within decades, but a fraction remains
                            lethally radioactive for periods that defy human
                            comprehension. Among the most concerning are:

                            For perspective: The entire span of human
                            civilization has unfolded in less than 6,000 years.
                            <em>Homo sapiens</em> walked out of Africa a mere
                            70,000 years ago, and even our species' oldest known
                            fossils, buried in Morocco’s Jebel Irhoud caves,
                            date back just 300,000 years. This radioactive waste
                            will outlast us not by centuries, but by deep time,
                            enough time for glaciers to carve entirely new
                            landscapes, for deserts to drown beneath new seas,
                            and for forests to rise and vanish a dozen times
                            over. In that span, new human species could evolve
                            from our lineage, adapted to climates we'd find
                            alien, only to go extinct long before the waste they
                            inherit from us ceases to be lethal.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            <strong>Plutonium-239 (Pu-239)</strong> poses the
                            most pressing concern: not only is it routinely
                            generated in reactors at far greater volumes than
                            other long-lived isotopes, but what makes it
                            particularly dangerous is not just its decay
                            timeline, but how long it remains lethally
                            radioactive. As it decays into uranium-235, it emits
                            deadly levels of alpha radiation. Inhaling or
                            ingesting even microscopic quantities of Pu-239 can
                            cause lung and bone cancers through persistent
                            internal irradiation, with no safe threshold for
                            exposure. A single microgram inhaled gives a 50%

                            But how much plutonium are we really talking about,
                            and what would a nuclear-powered civilization leave
                            behind? Consider this: today's reactors generate 70
                            tons of plutonium-239 annually, and nuclear accounts
                            for just 4.7% of global primary energy. To dethrone
                            fossil fuels, capacity would need to increase at
                            least tenfold, pushing annual Pu-239 production
                            beyond 700 tons within decades, just to meet current
                            demand.

                        <p>
                            A demand which, I must emphasize, has
                            <strong>doubled every 30 years since 1950</strong>
                            without plateauing. By 2100, we'd face 250,000 tons
                            waste, enough to contaminate an area twice the size
                            of England to hazardous levels. That's before
                            counting uranium mining's ecological scars, the 98
                            other radioactive isotopes in spent fuel, or the
                            inevitable accidents when operating 3,500+ reactors
                            (versus today's 440).

                            So what of modern developments in sequestration?
                            Proponents of nuclear energy love to cite today’s
                            reactors as models of waste management, boasting of
                            "rigorous protocols" and "exceedingly high safety
                            standards." And technically, they're not wrong. For
                            now. Spent fuel is first cooled in pools for years,
                            then encased in inert, corrosion-resistant casks
                            designed to last decades. Some materials, like
                            plutonium-239, remain entombed within highly
                            radioactive spent fuel rods, theoretically deterring
                            theft (since handling them unprotected would be
                            fatal).

                            All of this, however, is a sleight of hand: a
                            temporary fix masquerading as a permanent solution.
                            These storage methods buy us time, but not the kind
                            that matters. Steel and concrete degrade. Human
                            institutions falter. Even the most "fail-safe" casks
                            require maintenance, monitoring, and eventual
                            replacement within mere centuries, a blink compared
                            to the hundreds of millennia these materials remain
                            hazardous.

                            To put this in perspective: The Great Pyramid of
                            Giza, arguably humanity's most enduring physical
                            achievement, has stood for 4,500 years. King Tut's
                            tomb was sealed for 3,200 years before its
                            discovery. Yet both are orders of magnitude younger
                            than the timescales we're discussing for nuclear
                            waste. Civilizations collapse. Languages vanish.
                            Entire eras of knowledge evaporate. How do How do we
                            warn future societies, whether hyper-advanced or
                            post-collapse agrarian, that beneath their feet lies
                            poison that outlived empires? The U.S. Department of
                            Energy once convened linguists, anthropologists, and
                            materials scientists to tackle this very question.
                            Their proposed solutions ranged from obelisks
                            engraved with screaming faces to atomic priesthoods
                            perpetuating nuclear taboos through myth. It reads
                            like dystopian satire until you realize it's the

                            And before the rebuttal comes: What about recycling?
                            Yes, fast breeder reactors could theoretically
                            reduce plutonium stockpiles by reprocessing it into
                            fuel. But these systems remain prohibitively
                            expensive, politically radioactive, and after 70
                            years of research, still experimental at scale.
                            France's much-touted La Hague facility has
                            reprocessed less than 1% of global spent fuel, at
                            costs that would bankrupt any venture without heavy
                            subsidies. Worse, the process generates secondary
                            waste streams just as deadly as the original. If
                            humanity can't even be bothered to recycle plastic,
                            what are the odds we'll master plutonium
                            reprocessing at planetary scale? sustainably manage

                            Let's entertain a fantasy: Suppose we do solve
                            nuclear waste by burying it so meticulously that not
                            a single curie leaks for 200,000 years, as if
                            geological time were a spreadsheet we could lock
                            with a password. Even then, fission's fatal flaw
                            remains:

                            Uranium, the lifeblood of conventional reactors, is
                            not only finite but alarmingly scarce, and the
                            numbers don’t lie. The World Nuclear Association
                            estimates 6.1 million tons of economically
                            extractable uranium exist globally. At current
                            consumption rates (where nuclear supplies just 10%
                            of global electricity), this would last ~90 years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But here's the catch: fossil fuels still dominate
                            80% of the world's energy supply. Replacing them
                            entirely with nuclear would require
                            <strong>quintupling</strong> uranium demand, a
                            conservative estimate, given that global energy
                            consumption has doubled every 30 years since 1960.
                            Under business-as-usual growth, we wouldn't just
                            need five times the uranium; we'd need exponentially
                            more as demand continues to surge.

                            Even if we include all speculative reserves (an
                            additional 7.6 million tons, assuming mining costs
                            double or triple), we’d still exhaust the planet’s
                            uranium in <strong>less than 50 years</strong>, a
                            laughable timeline for a so-called "long-term"
                            solution. And this ignores the brutal reality of
                            extraction: uranium mining is energy-intensive,
                            environmentally destructive, and geopolitically
                            volatile.

                            200,000 kg of ore, while each ton mined leaves
                            behind 2-3 tons of radioactive waste.

                            limitations remain trapped in development purgatory.
                            reactors, which transmute non-fissile uranium-238
                            into plutonium-239, have been "just years away"
                            since Eisenhower's presidency; France's $12 billion
                            Superphénix, the most ambitious attempt, collapsed
                            under technical failures. Thorium reactors, often
                            touted as cleaner alternatives, still require
                            uranium or plutonium starters, nullifying their
                            supposed sustainability while remaining decades from

                            As of 2025, the world operates
                            <strong>440 nuclear reactors</strong>, supplying
                            <strong>~10% of global electricity</strong>. To
                            replace fossil fuels entirely, we’d need
                            <strong>~3,500 plants</strong>, requiring

                            But reactors take a decade or more to construct.
                            China, the fastest nation at nuclear construction,
                            managed ~5 years per reactor in recent years. The
                            U.S. and Europe average 10-15 years, often plagued
                            by delays and cost overruns. The recent Vogtle plant
                            expansion in Georgia serves as a grim testament:
                            initially projected to cost $14 billion and start in
                            2016/2017, it finally came online in 2023/2024 at a

                            Today, nuclear power is concentrated in a few dozen
                            nations with (relatively) stable governance and
                            advanced technical capabilities. Expanding it
                            globally to the extent required for meaningful
                            fossil fuel displacement means confronting
                            uncomfortable realities about who manages these
                            inherently dangerous technologies:

                                down the road, but a global nuclear fleet would
                                create an unprecedented volume of such waste,

                                significantly increases the risk of nuclear

                            Indonesia built hundreds of reactors, could
                            international oversight realistically prevent the
                            diversion of materials into clandestine weapons
                            programs? The geopolitical ramifications are
                            staggering and largely unaddressed by nuclear

                        <p>
                            Nuclear energy has historically never survived
                            without massive and continuous state subsidies. The
                            private sector, by and large, avoids the full
                            lifecycle costs and liability risks unless heavily
                            subsidized by taxpayers. Disasters like Chernobyl
                            and Fukushima saw governments footing astronomical
                            bills that would bankrupt any private entity.

                            Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), to power their
                            energy-intensive AI data centers doesn't change this
                            fundamental equation. While these companies seek
                            stable, low-carbon energy, their interest often
                            hinges on public de-risking of these ventures. This
                            push for "privatized" nuclear solutions typically
                            leads to:
