                            I’ve watched
                            <span class="em-dash"

                            a troubling paradigm shift take hold in climate
                            discourse: the sudden rehabilitation of nuclear
                            energy as an environmentalist dark horse. Once a
                            taboo subject, nuclear power is now being framed as
                            a misunderstood savior, a necessary compromise in
                            the desperate scramble to cut emissions.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The argument goes like this: With time running out,
                            renewables alone<span class="em-dash"
                                >—solar, wind, geothermal—</span
                            >can’t possibly meet 21st-century energy demands.
                            Nuclear, we’re told, is the pragmatic solution—a
                            dense, reliable energy source unfairly maligned by
                            outdated fears. Some proponents go further, painting
                            opposition to nuclear as the result of a shadowy
                            smear campaign by oil and gas interests.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            There are kernels of truth in these claims. Modern
                            reactor designs <em>are</em> safer than their
                            predecessors. Nuclear <em>does</em> offer a
                            low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. But beneath
                            this seductive narrative lies a far more dangerous
                            gamble—one its most vocal advocates downplay or
                            ignore entirely.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Because here’s the uncomfortable reality: If someone
                            promises to solve all your problems without
                            requiring a single sacrifice, they’re not a
                            revolutionary. They’re a charlatan.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Before dissecting the logistics, we must first
                            confront a moral imperative:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The decisions we make today<span class="em-dash"
                                >—particularly regarding the widespread adoption
                                of nuclear fission—</span
                            >will not die with us. They will not even die with
                            the children of tomorrow, who will have long
                            forgotten our ways. These choices, made in service
                            of our immediate needs, will echo across timescales
                            so vast they dwarf the entirety of human history. To
                            scale nuclear energy as aggressively as some propose
                            is to permanently alter the trajectory of this
                            planet—not for decades or centuries, but for
                            geological epochs. And it will not affect us alone.
                            Every living being on Earth, present and future,
                            inherits this legacy.

                            Nuclear fission produces byproducts. Most become
                            harmless within decades, but a fraction remains
                            lethally radioactive for periods that defy human
                            comprehension. Among the most concerning are:

                            fossils, buried in Morocco’s Jebel Irhoud caves,
                            date back just 300,000 years. This radioactive waste
                            will outlast us not by centuries, but by geologic
                            epochs—enough time for glaciers to carve entirely
                            new landscapes, for deserts to drown beneath new
                            seas, and for forests to rise and vanish a dozen
                            times over. In that span, new human species could

                            <strong>Plutonium-239 (Pu-239)</strong> poses the
                            most pressing concern—not only is it routinely
                            generated in reactors at far greater volumes than
                            other long-lived isotopes, but what makes it
                            particularly dangerous is not just its decay
                            timeline, but how long it remains
                            <em>lethally</em> radioactive. As it decays into
                            uranium-235, it emits deadly levels of alpha
                            radiation. Inhaling or ingesting even microscopic
                            quantities of Pu-239 can cause lung and bone cancers
                            through persistent internal irradiation, with no
                            safe threshold for exposure. A single microgram
                            inhaled gives a 50% chance of fatal lung cancer.

                        <p>
                            But how much plutonium are we really talking
                            about—and what would a nuclear-powered civilization
                            leave behind? Consider this: today's reactors
                            generate 70 tons of plutonium-239 annually—and
                            nuclear accounts for just 4.7% of global primary
                            energy. To dethrone fossil fuels, capacity would
                            need to increase <em>at least tenfold</em>, pushing
                            annual Pu-239 production beyond 700 tons within
                            decades—just to meet <em>current</em> demand.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            A demand which, I must emphasize, has
                            <strong>doubled every 30 years since 1950</strong>
                            without plateauing. By 2100, we'd face 250,000 tons
                            of Pu-239 waste—enough to contaminate an area twice
                            the size of England to hazardous levels. That's
                            before counting uranium mining's ecological scars,
                            the 98 other radioactive isotopes in spent fuel, or
                            the inevitable accidents when operating 3,500+
                            reactors (versus today's 440).

                        <p>
                            So what of modern developments in sequestration?
                            Proponents of nuclear energy love to cite today’s
                            reactors as models of waste management, boasting of
                            "rigorous protocols" and "exceedingly high safety
                            standards." And technically, they’re not wrong—for
                            now. Spent fuel is first cooled in pools for years,
                            then encased in inert, corrosion-resistant casks
                            designed to last decades. Some materials, like
                            plutonium-239, remain entombed within highly
                            radioactive spent fuel rods, theoretically deterring
                            theft (since handling them unprotected would be
                            fatal).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            All of this, however, is a sleight of hand—a
                            temporary fix masquerading as a permanent solution.
                            These storage methods buy us <em>time</em>, but not
                            the kind that matters. Steel and concrete degrade.
                            Human institutions falter. Even the most "fail-safe"
                            casks require maintenance, monitoring, and eventual
                            replacement within mere centuries—a blink compared
                            to the hundreds of millennia these materials remain
                            hazardous.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            To put this in perspective: The Great Pyramid of
                            Giza, arguably humanity’s most enduring physical
                            achievement, has stood for 4,500 years. King Tut’s
                            tomb was sealed for 3,200 years before its
                            discovery. Yet <em>both</em> are orders of magnitude
                            younger than the timescales we’re discussing for
                            nuclear waste. Civilizations collapse. Languages
                            vanish. Entire epochs of knowledge evaporate. How do
                            we warn future societies—whether hyper-advanced or
                            post-collapse agrarian—that beneath their feet lies
                            poison that outlived empires? The U.S. Department of
                            Energy once convened linguists, anthropologists, and
                            materials scientists to tackle this very question.
                            Their proposed solutions ranged from obelisks
                            engraved with screaming faces to atomic priesthoods
                            perpetuating nuclear taboos through myth. It reads
                            like dystopian satire—until you realize it’s the
                            <em>best</em> we’ve got.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And before the rebuttal comes:
                            <em>What about recycling?</em> Yes, fast breeder
                            reactors could <em>theoretically</em> reduce
                            plutonium stockpiles by reprocessing it into fuel.
                            But these systems remain prohibitively expensive,
                            politically radioactive, and—after 70 years of
                            research—still experimental at scale. France’s
                            much-touted La Hague facility has reprocessed less
                            than 1% of global spent fuel, at costs that would
                            bankrupt any venture without heavy subsidies. Worse,
                            the process generates secondary waste streams just
                            as deadly as the original. If humanity can’t even be
                            bothered to recycle plastic, what are the odds we’ll
                            sustainably manage plutonium?

                            This isn’t pessimism—it’s physics. The nuclear
                            industry’s assurances crumble under the weight of
                            time. We are playing alchemists, conjuring problems
                            we lack the wisdom to contain.

                        <p>
                            Let’s entertain a fantasy: Suppose we
                            <em>do</em> solve nuclear waste—burying it so
                            meticulously that not a single curie leaks for
                            200,000 years, as if geological time were a
                            spreadsheet we could lock with a password. Even
                            then, fission’s fatal flaw remains:

                            Uranium, the lifeblood of conventional reactors, is
                            not only finite but alarmingly scarce—and the
                            numbers don’t lie. The World Nuclear Association
                            estimates 6.1 million tons of economically
                            extractable uranium exist globally. At current
                            consumption rates (where nuclear supplies just 10%
                            of global electricity), this would last ~90 years.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            But here’s the catch: fossil fuels still dominate
                            80% of the world’s energy supply. Replacing them
                            entirely with nuclear would require
                            <strong>quintupling</strong> uranium demand—a
                            conservative estimate, given that global energy
                            consumption has doubled every 30 years since 1960.
                            Under business-as-usual growth, we wouldn’t just
                            need <em>five times</em> the uranium—we’d need
                            <em>exponentially more</em> as demand continues to
                            surge.

                        <p>
                            Even if we include all speculative reserves (an
                            additional 7.6 million tons, assuming mining costs
                            double or triple), we’d still exhaust the planet’s
                            uranium in <strong>less than 50 years</strong>—a
                            laughable timeline for a so-called "long-term"
                            solution. And this ignores the brutal reality of
                            extraction: uranium mining is energy-intensive,
                            environmentally destructive, and geopolitically
                            volatile.

                            Producing nuclear fuel is staggeringly inefficient:
                            just 1 kg of usable uranium requires processing
                            200,000 kg of ore, while each ton mined leaves
                            behind 2-3 tons of radioactive waste.

                            As of 2025, the world operates
                            <strong>440 nuclear reactors</strong>, supplying
                            <strong>~10% of global electricity</strong>. To
                            replace fossil fuels entirely, we’d need

                            But reactors take a decade or more to construct.
                            China—the fastest nation at nuclear
                            construction—managed ~5 years per reactor in recent
                            years. The U.S. and Europe average 10-15 years,
                            often plagued by delays and cost overruns. The
                            recent Vogtle plant expansion in Georgia serves as a
                            grim testament: initially projected to cost $14
                            billion and start in 2016/2017, it finally came
                            online in 2023/2024 at a cost exceeding $30 billion.

                            Today, nuclear power is concentrated in a few dozen
                            nations with (relatively) stable governance and
                            advanced technical capabilities. Expanding it

                                create an unprecedented volume of such waste,

                            Nuclear energy has historically never survived
                            without massive and continuous state subsidies. The
                            private sector, by and large, avoids the full
                            lifecycle costs and liability risks unless heavily
                            subsidized by taxpayers. Disasters like Chernobyl
                            and Fukushima saw governments footing astronomical
                            bills that would bankrupt any private entity.

                            fundamental equation. While these companies seek
                            stable, low-carbon energy, their interest often
                            hinges on public de-risking of these ventures. This
                            push for "privatized" nuclear solutions typically

                            quo, rather than embracing the profound, necessary,
                            and ultimately more rewarding task of building a
                            truly sustainable civilization. Future generations,
                            burdened by our radioactive legacy and a potentially
                            depleted planet, are unlikely to thank us for this
                            monumental evasion.
