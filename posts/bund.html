                        <p>
                            On August 23, 1918, a 19-year-old Jewish American
                            named Hyman Rosansky was arrested for tossing
                            antiwar leaflets out of a fourth-floor window of a
                            Lower Manhattan hat factory. The flyers—printed in
                            both Yiddish and English—denounced U.S. intervention
                            in the Russian Revolution and called for a general
                            strike among American workers. Rosansky belonged to
                            a small circle of Jewish activists, all immigrants
                            from the Russian Empire, that included Jacob Abrams,
                            Mollie Steimer, Samuel Lipman, and Hyman Lachowsky
                            (no relation). Each had carried revolutionary ideals
                            across the Atlantic, though such radicalism was
                            hardly foreign to American Jewish communities of the
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            This was, after all, the turbulent world of Jewish
                            New York in the early twentieth century—a vibrant,
                            unruly ecosystem of anarchist newspapers, socialist
                            collectives, and grand union halls where the air was
                            thick with cigarette smoke and bold new ideas. At
                            the heart of it all was the Yiddish language, which
                            had cemented itself as the radical Jew's tongue of
                            choice—the medium through which thousands of
                            working-class immigrants debated politics, poetry,
                            and the future of humanity without tipping off Uncle
                            Sam. In this brief window of history before
                            Hollywood rose to prominence, New York was
                            <strong>the</strong> stage for anyone in need of a
                            good kvetch. Through a network of basement
                            publications, the city itself was transformed into a
                            smorgasbord of food for thought: there was the
                            communist Morgen Freiheit (Morning Freedom), the
                            socialist Forverts (The Forward), and the anarchist
                            Fraye Arbeter Shtime (Free Voice of Labor), just to
                            name a few.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Fraye Arbeter Shtime, in fact, was so successful
                            that it became the longest-running anarchist
                            newspaper in the world, agitating against
                            capitalism, war, and oppression almost exclusively
                            in Yiddish from 1890 all the way until 1977.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            For Jewish immigrants fresh off the boat from the
                            Pale of Settlement, these radical circles weren't
                            just political organizations—they were communities,
                            support networks, and the only institutions that
                            seemed to understand their particular brand of
                            diasporic despair. And this despair wasn't abstract
                            either—it was forged in the brutal realities of
                            immigrant life. Take for example the Triangle
                            Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, which a couple
                            years prior had killed 146 workers, most of them
                            young Jewish and Italian immigrant women.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            For most Americans (who have only ever discussed
                            this tragedy in the context of a high school civics
                            class), it's easy to reduce the entire affair to a
                            statistical footnote—one that inched the system
                            closer to today's workplace safety reforms. But for
                            the Jews living through this period—a generation of
                            traumatized immigrants who had just escaped pogroms
                            in the Old World—the last thing these events spawned
                            were calls for mourning and incremental reform.
                            These people were systemically overworked and
                            unimaginably exhausted. They had barely escaped the
                            hellscape of Europe, only to have the horrifying
                            images of their wives, mothers, sisters, and friends
                            leaping from burning buildings seared permanently
                            into their fucking skulls. So (understandably)
                            incremental reform didn't exactly satiate one's
                            needs during this period. There wasn't time for
                            penning representatives, nor was there today's
                            tradition of providing sad testimonies in front of
                            deaf congressional ears—the moment demanded
                            something fucking biblical. An eye for an eye. The
                            law of retaliation. It was time for a good old
                            fashion
                            <em class="text-red">revolt</em>.

                        <p>
                            Echoing from brownstone basements and sweating
                            across factory floors, the Jews of this
                            era—alongside other fed-up immigrant
                            communities—harnessed this anger and began to forge
                            something incredible, something never before seen in
                            the new world or old:

                                of working-class immigrants from all over the

                        <p>
                            But I digress—back to the other window, the
                            fourth-floor one where Hyman Rosansky's pamphlets
                            —not people—rained down.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Rosansky and his comrades were operating in a moment
                            of intense political paranoia. The United States had
                            just entered World War I, and the Espionage Act of
                            1917 had made opposition to the war effort a federal
                            crime. When they printed and distributed their
                            anti-war leaflets, they weren't just expressing
                            political opinions—they were committing what the
                            government considered sedition. The flyers accused
                            President Woodrow Wilson of being a "hypocrite" and
                            a "coward" for sending troops to Russia, and called
                            on American workers to resist what they saw as an
                            imperialist intervention against the Bolshevik
                            Revolution.

                            The consequences were predictably brutal. Federal
                            agents raided the group's printing press, arresting
                            all six defendants. During interrogation, Abrams was
                            beaten so severely by police that he suffered
                            permanent injuries. Jacob Schwartz, tragically, was
                            not so lucky. In custody he was treated so
                            inhumanely that he died before ever seeing a day in
                            court—becoming a martyr to the cause of free speech.
                            The trial that followed was a spectacle of
                            anti-immigrant and anti-radical hysteria, with the
                            defendants' Jewishness and political beliefs treated
                            as evidence of their disloyalty.

                            The case eventually reached the Supreme Court as
                            Abrams v. United States, where Justice Oliver
                            Wendell Holmes Jr.—writing for the majority—upheld
                            the convictions in what remains one of the most
                            infamous free speech decisions in American history.
                            Still, I'll offer Holmes a few crumbs of credit: in
                            his dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Louis
                            Brandeis, he articulated what would become the
                            foundational principle of modern First Amendment
                            legal theory—the "marketplace of ideas." He argued
                            that

                            The irony was exquisite: a group of Jewish
                            anarchists, prosecuted for their radical politics,
                            inadvertently helped establish the very free speech
                            protections that would later shield countless
                            dissidents. In theory, this could have been a proud
                            moment for America—but the fuckers still opted to
                            uphold the original charges... So it would seem not
                            much has tangibly changed on Capitol Hill over the
                            past century.

                            All six activists were sentenced to up to 20 years
                            in prison for the crime of putting pen to paper,
                            though most would ultimately be deported to what had
                            become Soviet Russia after serving just 1-2 years.

                            Which brings us full circle, back across the
                            Atlantic and—slightly rewound in time—to the late
                            19th century Russian Empire. This was not exactly
                            what you'd call a welcoming environment for Jews.
                            The reason Hyman and his peers ended up in New York
                            in the first place was pretty simple: the czar was a
                            fucking prick. The Jewish experience in this place
                            and time included being legally confined to the Pale
                            of Settlement—a state-sanctioned ghetto spanning
                            386,000 square miles where conditions were grim.
                            Jews couldn't own land, couldn't attend universities
                            in meaningful numbers, had their movements
                            constantly monitored, and were basically the
                            Empire's favorite scapegoat whenever the peasants
                            got restless. It was like being perpetually stuck in
                            the world's worst game of musical chairs, except the
                            music was anti-Semitic propaganda and the chairs
                            were boats to America.

                            In this pressure cooker of oppression, where pogroms
                            were as common as the weather was bad, something
                            remarkable happened. In 1897, in the back room of a
                            Vilnius apartment that probably smelled of boiled
                            cabbage and revolutionary B.O., thirteen delegates
                            from various Jewish socialist circles gathered in
                            secret. They weren't just kvetching about the
                            Tsar—they were planning to build a movement that
                            would fundamentally challenge how Jews thought about
                            their place in the world.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            These weren't your typical shtetl Jews waiting for
                            the messiah. They were secular, educated, and
                            fiercely committed to the idea that Jewish
                            liberation couldn't be achieved through prayer or
                            emigration alone. They called themselves the
                            <strong
                                >General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland
                                and Russia</strong
                            >, or just "the Bund" for short. Their founding
                            principle was breathtakingly radical for its time:
                            Jews should organize not as a separate nation, but
                            as workers. Crucially, many Bundists saw their
                            approach not just as an alternative to Zionism, but
                            as a superior ideology—one that addressed the root
                            causes of anti-Semitism rather than "fleeing" from
                            them.

                        <p>
                            The Bund grew like wildfire through the Pale. By
                            1903, they had organized the first mass Jewish
                            self-defense groups during the Kishinev pogrom,
                            proving that Jews wouldn't just passively accept
                            violence anymore. They established underground
                            printing presses that churned out Yiddish
                            newspapers, created schools that taught secular
                            subjects alongside Jewish culture, and organized
                            strikes that brought entire industries to their
                            knees.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Their biggest idea? That Jewish workers should
                            organize not just with other Jews, but with
                            <em>everyone</em>—Poles, Lithuanians, Russians,
                            Ukrainians. They wanted to build a coalition—one
                            which, had they ever witnessed a single day of good
                            weather, might have shared its name with the
                            aforementioned rainbow forming across the pond. The
                            Bundists argued that anti-Semitism wasn't some
                            eternal, immutable feature of human society, but a
                            deliberate tool used by the ruling class to divide
                            workers and prevent them from organizing
                            collectively. Their solution was elegantly simple:
                            if workers of all backgrounds united against their
                            common oppressors, anti-Semitism would wither away
                            like last week's challah.

                        <p>
                            The Bund wasn't just some book club for disgruntled
                            intellectuals either. At its peak, it had around
                            <strong>40,000 members</strong>—which, in today's
                            terms, is roughly equivalent to the entire
                            population of a mid-sized American city deciding to
                            form a revolutionary socialist organization. They
                            had newspapers, they had schools, they had cultural
                            programs, and most importantly, they had
                            <em>songs</em>. Oh, the songs! The Bundists
                            understood something that modern activists have
                            largely forgotten: if your revolution doesn't have a
                            good soundtrack, you're basically fucked.

                        <p>
                            And what a soundtrack it was! The Bund produced some
                            absolute bangers. Decades before N.W.A., Jewish
                            workers in the Pale were singing: "Daloy Politsey"
                            ("Down with the Police"). A song about police
                            brutality and state oppression with a revolutionary
                            twang so potent that if Ice Cube spoke Yiddish, he
                            might melt.

                            But "Daloy Politsey" was just the warm-up act. Their
                            most famous tune, "Di Shvue" (The Oath), wasn't just
                            a catchy jingle—it was a full-throated declaration
                            of class solidarity that would make your average
                            TikTok activist virtue signal until completion.
                            Picture thousands of Jewish workers, arms linked,
                            singing in Yiddish about international brotherhood
                            while pledging themselves to the cause.

                            It was beautiful, it was powerful, and it
                            represented a vision of Jewish liberation that was
                            about to be tested by the brutal realities of the
                            20th century.

                        <p>
                            The Bund's central thesis, above all else, was
                            elegantly simple: Jewish liberation couldn't happen
                            in isolation. They argued—correctly, I might
                            add—that anti-Semitism was fundamentally a tool of
                            the ruling class to divide workers and prevent them
                            from organizing collectively. Their solution? Build
                            bridges. Forge alliances. Create a multi-ethnic
                            workers' movement so powerful that the Tsar would
                            shit his royal pants.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And in the years leading up to the 1905 Russian
                            Revolution, it looked like they might actually pull
                            it off. The Bund organized massive strikes that
                            paralyzed entire cities. They formed armed
                            self-defense units that protected Jewish
                            neighborhoods from pogroms. They even helped create
                            the first soviets (workers' councils) in cities like
                            Vilnius and Minsk. For a brief, shining moment, it
                            seemed like the rainbow coalition might actually
                            work—Jewish workers marching alongside Polish
                            workers, Russian workers, Lithuanian workers, all
                            united against the Tsarist regime.

                        <p>
                            The Bund's influence quickly began to extend beyond
                            the Pale. They became founding members of the
                            Russian Social Democratic Labour Party—the same
                            organization that would later split into the
                            Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. At the 1903 party
                            congress, however, their vision of ethnic solidarity
                            faced its first major test. The Bund demanded
                            recognition as the sole representative of Jewish
                            workers within the party, arguing that Jewish
                            workers faced unique forms of oppression that
                            required specific organizational forms. When the
                            party refused, the Bund walked out—a move that
                            ironically helped Lenin's Bolsheviks gain a majority
                            (the word "Bolshevik" literally means "majority").
                            Still, they were, in essence, the original
                            intersectional leftists, decades before anyone had
                            coined the term or ruined it on Reddit.

                        <p>
                            Alas, here's where the story takes a turn from
                            inspiring to "oy gevalt." While the Bund was
                            building its revolutionary workers' movement and
                            seeking solidarity across ethnic lines, pogroms once
                            again reared their ugly head throughout the Pale.
                            The brutal reality of ethnic hatred manifested
                            itself at the exact moment they were trying so hard
                            to transcend it. The Kishinev pogrom of 1903 was
                            particularly devastating—49 Jews murdered, hundreds
                            injured, and thousands of homes and businesses
                            destroyed in a city where the Bund had built one of
                            its strongest cross-ethnic networks.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In cities like Kishinev and Odessa, the betrayal was
                            bitter beyond words. Many of their supposed
                            socialist allies in other ethnic groups—the very
                            comrades they had organized strikes with, shared
                            revolutionary literature with, sung "The
                            Internationale" with—either stood by silently or, in
                            some cases, actively participated in the violence.
                            Jewish workers who had marched alongside their
                            Polish and Russian comrades found themselves
                            abandoned when the mobs came. Former comrades who
                            had once shared bread and revolutionary dreams now
                            stood among the perpetrators, their internationalist
                            principles evaporating in the heat of ethnic rage.

                            The revolution of 1905 failed, and the Tsarist
                            regime came back with a vengeance. The Bund went
                            underground again, their newspapers banned, their
                            leaders arrested or exiled. But they persisted,
                            organizing in secret, maintaining their vision even
                            after it had been brutally betrayed.

                            A further blow came with the rise of the Bolsheviks.
                            Lenin and his crew had about as much patience for
                            Jewish cultural autonomy as your average child has
                            for the Haggadah. They saw the Bund's emphasis on
                            Jewish identity as "bourgeois nationalism" and
                            systematically dismantled the organization after the
                            1917 Revolution. Bundist leaders were arrested,
                            their newspapers shut down, their cultural
                            institutions liquidated. What the Tsarist regime
                            couldn't accomplish through pogroms, the Bolsheviks
                            achieved through bureaucracy.

                            But the true tragedy unfolded in the 1930s and
                            1940s. As the Shoah descended upon Eastern Europe,
                            the very communities where the Bund had built its
                            rainbow coalition became killing fields. Vilnius,
                            Warsaw, Minsk—cities that had once echoed with "Di
                            Shvue" and "Daloy Politsey"—became the sites of
                            ghettos and mass executions. The Bundists who
                            survived the initial Soviet repression often met
                            their end in the Nazi death camps, their dream
                            crushed by the ultimate expression of ethnic hatred.

                            Consider Mordechai Gebirtig, a Jewish poet, Bundist,
                            and folksinger from Kraków with an electric smile
                            who wrote cheerful labor songs like "Ejns, tswej,
                            draj, fir, arbetlose senen mir! / One, two, three,
                            four, we are the unemployed!" His songs became
                            staples of Yiddish theatre productions wherever they
                            were performed, lovingly sung the world over. He was
                            shot by Germans in the Kraków Ghetto, occupied
                            Poland, during the darkest days of the Shoah.

                            What little remained of Bundist Jewry after the war
                            would be dealt a final blow soon enough. The
                            post-war period saw Stalin finish the job with his
                            iconic and systematic purges, leaving the Bund
                            little more than a memory—a beautiful, tragic memory
                            of what might have been. The organization that had
                            once mobilized 40,000 members, that had organized
                            armed self-defense units and mass strikes, that had
                            created a vibrant Yiddish cultural renaissance, was
                            systematically erased from Soviet history books.

                            The Bund's story is particularly poignant when
                            compared to the undeniable successes of the Zionist
                            movement throughout the 20th century and beyond.
                            There were many among the Bundists who not only
                            pitied, but loathed the Zionists. They rejected what
                            they saw as Zionist pessimism toward immovable
                            ethnic divisions, interpreting the desire to
                            relocate to the ancestral homeland as a cowardly
                            retreat from the world stage. This sentiment can be
                            clearly observed in songs such as "Oy, Ir Narishe
                            Tsionistn - Oh, You Foolish Little Zionists."

                        <p>
                            The bitter irony is that history proved the Zionists
                            right in the most horrific way possible. When push
                            came to shove, the Bund's non-Jewish socialist
                            comrades abandoned them wholesale. Its ideological
                            foundations were systematically destroyed by
                            pogroms, Soviet repression, and ultimately the
                            Shoah. The dream of cross-ethnic solidarity
                            shattered like a glass at a Jewish wedding. The
                            tragedy of the Bund isn't that they failed—it's that
                            they represented a beautiful, radical vision of
                            Jewish liberation that history ultimately proved
                            untenable for the times.

                            The Zionists, meanwhile, were building a state that
                            would go on to provide refuge for millions
                            (including former Bundists)—an achievement that all
                            but cemented Zionism's staunch pragmatism in the
                            minds of many Jews around the world today. The
                            message, for most, was this: The "marketplace of
                            ideas" coined by Holmes had spoken.
                            <strong>The Bund had lost.</strong>

                        <p>
                            Still, the Bund's vision of a rainbow coalition
                            hadn't fully faded into obscurity. For many, the
                            theory wasn't wrong—it was just tragically
                            premature. Back across the pond, the Jewish left
                            (which had faced similar challenges leading up to
                            and, of course, during the war) was still kicking.
                            Sure, the horrors of the Shoah had deterred many
                            optimists from the cause. Additionally, two
                            subsequent world wars had all but stalled most of
                            America's discourse around domestic policy. But most
                            Jews hadn't given up—they were just licking their
                            wounds and biding their time.

                            The vision outlined by the Bundists would,
                            therefore, remain in slumber for some years. The
                            post-war period of 1945-1960 would see America's
                            hands full with a number of new international crises
                            unfolding. The Jewish community in the states, now
                            turning its attention to the fledgling state of
                            Israel, had plenty on its plate as well with the
                            1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1956 Suez Crisis. But
                            soon the dream of a rainbow coalition would
                            resurface in a big way. By the 1960s, racial unity
                            was becoming groovy again.

                            The civil rights movement gained momentum, anti-war
                            protests rocked college campuses, and a new
                            generation of activists was once again dreaming of
                            building bridges across racial and ethnic lines. The
                            1960s saw its share of ups and downs along the path
                            to the other side of the rainbow—from the hope of
                            the 1963 March on Washington to the devastation of
                            Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968. By
                            the end of the decade in the year 1969, the vision
                            was not only clear, its new champions had decided
                            enough was enough. It was once again time to act.

                            "Rainbow Coalition"—the big enchilada to which I
                            have been alluding, the Bund's vision reincarnated
                            in the crucible of Chicago's urban struggle. If the
                            Bund was the theoretical blueprint for cross-ethnic
                            solidarity, the Rainbow Coalition was its practical,
                            street-level implementation. And what an
                            implementation it was! Picture this: Black Panthers,
                            Appalachian "hillbillies" from the Young Patriots
                            Organization, and Puerto Rican Young Lords all
                            marching together under one banner. It was the kind
                            of coalition that would have made the old Bundists
                            weep with joy.

                        <p>
                            Fred Hampton, the charismatic 21-year-old leader of
                            the Illinois Black Panther Party, understood
                            <em>precisely</em> what the Bund had argued decades
                            prior, and delivered its gospel to the American
                            masses with such eloquence that few could ignore it
                            for long. He famously replaced "white man" with
                            "capitalist" in the Panther's Ten-Point Program—a
                            rhetorical move straight out of the Pale of
                            Settlement, where Jews had subbed "gentile" for
                            "capitalist" in their own liberation struggles. The
                            Young Patriots, those "dislocated hillbillies" from
                            Kentucky and West Virginia, weren't just tolerated
                            by Hampton—they were embraced as comrades. They even
                            kept their Confederate flags, arguing that they were
                            symbols of poor white resistance, not racism.
                            Personally, I find their argument to be a load of
                            shit... but you gotta admit the level of restraint
                            shown by the Black Panther Party towards such
                            flagrant displays of ignorance—all in the pursuit of
                            maintaining the coalition's collective bargaining
                            power—is absolutely awe-inspiring. A level of nuance
                            and strategic might sorely missing on today's
                            college campuses and town squares.

                            Once more, the Rainbow Coalition (like the Bund
                            before it) wasn't about holding hands and singing
                            "Kumbaya." That was for the '69 attendees of
                            Woodstock next door in upstate New York—the ones who
                            would become bankers and executives, not label
                            themselves enemies of the state. The Rainbow
                            Coalition organized free breakfast programs for
                            children, health clinics for the uninsured, and
                            legal services for the oppressed. They marched on
                            police stations to protest brutality and organized
                            against gentrification. In other words, they did the
                            actual work of building community power while
                            everyone else was arguing about theory. At its peak,
                            the coalition included not just the Panthers,
                            Patriots, and Lords, but also Rising Up Angry, the
                            Brown Berets, the American Indian Movement, and the
                            Red Guard Party. It was a beautiful, chaotic,
                            multi-ethnic mess of radical organizing that
                            actually worked.

                            American Jews, of course, were there all along,
                            fighting beside Panthers, Patriots, and Lords (oh
                            my). Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement
                            was substantial and often overlooked—from the two
                            Jewish activists (Andrew Goodman and Michael
                            Schwerner) murdered alongside James Chaney in
                            Mississippi, to the countless Jewish lawyers who
                            provided legal defense for civil rights workers, to
                            the disproportionate number of Jewish students who
                            participated in Freedom Summer.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            And speaking of Jewish students, let's talk about a
                            bright young socialist from Brooklyn who was just
                            beginning to cut his political teeth during this
                            period. A certain Bernie Sanders made his first
                            appearance on the stage of political theater in
                            1963, when he was arrested by Chicago police while
                            protesting school segregation alongside members of
                            what would later become the Rainbow Coalition. The
                            arrest wasn't just a youthful indiscretion—it was a
                            formative experience that would shape his entire
                            political career. Here was a Jewish activist,
                            inspired by the same cross-racial solidarity that
                            had animated the Bund, getting his hands dirty in
                            what would become a life-long struggle for justice.

                        <p>
                            And then, of course, the state crushed Fred Hampton
                            like so many before him. Because that's what states
                            do to rainbow coalitions and charismatic
                            butterflies. The FBI under COINTELPRO (Counter
                            Intelligence Program) saw Hampton's ability to unite
                            people across racial lines as the ultimate threat.
                            An informant named William O'Neal infiltrated the
                            Panthers, drugged Hampton, and provided the floor
                            plan for the December 4, 1969 predawn raid that left
                            Hampton and Mark Clark dead in a hail of police
                            bullets. The message was clear: cross-racial
                            solidarity would not be tolerated.

                        <p>
                            The movement had taken a significant blow, one which
                            would send it back to the underground for the next
                            decade, but the vision for a rainbow coalition
                            didn't die with Hampton either.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Enter Jesse Jackson, the charismatic Baptist
                            minister who saw the power of the rainbow coalition
                            concept and decided to mainstream it in the 1980s.
                            Jackson's Operation PUSH (People United to Save
                            Humanity) and later the National Rainbow Coalition
                            represented a more moderate, electoral version of
                            Hampton's radical vision. Jackson's 1984 and 1988
                            presidential campaigns brought the concept of a
                            "rainbow coalition" into mainstream American
                            politics, arguing that progressive change required
                            building bridges between Black, Brown, White,
                            Latino, Asian, Native, Jewish, and all other
                            (willing) progressive voters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For American Jews watching Jackson's campaign
                            unfold, it was a familiar and warmly welcomed tune.
                            As if the clock had struck midnight once more, the
                            rainbow was peeking out from the clouds. There was
                            that particular resonance again—the Bund was getting
                            back together. Many Jewish activists, particularly
                            those who had grown up with stories of the Bund from
                            their grandparents, saw in Jackson's coalition a
                            chance to revive that old vision. They flocked to
                            his campaigns, donating money, organizing support,
                            and believing that maybe, just maybe, this time it
                            would work.

                        <br />
                        <p>And then came Hymietown.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In 1984, during his first presidential campaign,
                            Jackson was overheard by a Washington Post reporter
                            disparagingly referring to New York City as
                            "Hymietown" in a conversation with a Black
                            journalist. For those unfamiliar with the term,
                            "Hymie" is a derogatory slur for Jewish people—a
                            diminutive of the Hebrew name Hyman, the same name
                            borne by Hyman Rosansky and Hyman Lachowsky, two of
                            the Jewish anarchists whose story opened this very
                            post. The comment exploded into a national scandal,
                            revealing the fragility of the very rainbow
                            coalition Jackson was trying to build.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            For so many Jews, the rainbow coalition up until now
                            had been stitching the still fresh wounds left by
                            the annihilation of the Bund decades prior. In a
                            single, awful moment, Reverend Jackson had nipped
                            the arteries of an entire generation of bleeding
                            hearts. The Hymietown incident exposed a deep-seated
                            anti-Semitism lurking beneath the surface of his
                            coalition, forcing a painful reckoning about the
                            persistence of age-old prejudice even within the
                            most progressive of movements. Jewish support for
                            Jackson plummeted, and while he would continue his
                            political career, the dream of a truly inclusive
                            rainbow coalition had been dealt a serious blow.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            And so the cycle continued: the Bund's timeless
                            vision of cross-ethnic solidarity rose, inspired
                            hope, and promptly got crushed by external forces or
                            internal contradictions. From Vilnius to Chicago,
                            from 1897 to 1969 to 1984, the dream persisted even
                            as the obstacles remained formidable. The question
                            wasn't whether the vision was beautiful—it was. The
                            question was whether we had learned enough from past
                            failures to make it work this time around.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Which brings us to my turn in this long story. I was
                            born in 1997, the spawn of a bleeding heart
                            progressive in a long line of Jewish voices. At age
                            8, with a tamagotchi in hand and absolutely no
                            understanding of what a presidential election
                            actually meant, my parents had me knocking on doors
                            in a red state (Arizona) campaigning for Barack
                            Obama. This wasn't just political indoctrination—it
                            was the continuation of a family tradition, the
                            latest chapter in the Bund's unfinished story. In
                            middle school, I attended my share of Occupy
                            protests, watching as my generation rediscovered the
                            language of class struggle that the Bund had spoken
                            so fluently. In high school, I sat in local Green
                            Party chapters discussing climate change response,
                            watching the environmental movement grapple with the
                            same questions of cross-class, cross-racial
                            solidarity that had animated the Bundists a century
                            earlier.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            By the time I was 18 and eligible to vote, there it
                            was again—the rainbow peeking out from the clouds.
                            Bernie Sanders hit the American mainstream like a
                            bowl of ice cream to the Jewish gut. It was a time
                            of my life where I had just graduated high school
                            (2015), dropped out of my first stint with college
                            (2016), and moved to New York City. I had, at this
                            time, absolutely no clue what I was doing—in life,
                            in work, spiritually, or otherwise. The only thing I
                            knew was that Bernie Sanders was it, and I wanted
                            in. I attended rallies, knocked on doors, corralled
                            my peers, and did all that I could in '16 to fight
                            for the vision I would later come to acknowledge as
                            originally the Bund's.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            From a historical lens, this time felt incredibly
                            different. I mean Christ, America had just achieved
                            the impossible and elected a two-term Black
                            president. A socialist Jew seemed like a natural
                            next step! The coalition Bernie was building—young
                            people, working-class voters across racial lines,
                            progressive activists—felt like the Bund's vision
                            updated for the digital age. Here was a Jewish
                            candidate who understood that class solidarity could
                            bridge racial divides, who spoke about healthcare
                            and education as universal rights rather than
                            privileges, who argued that the real division in
                            America wasn't between races but between the
                            billionaire class and everyone else.

                            He lost, of course. Trump won. Darkness prevailed.
                            But the left showed America something it hadn't seen
                            before: establishment panic not behind closed CIA
                            doors but out in the open. Corporate panic was on
                            every television channel and sprawled all over the
                            internet. The Democratic National Committee's
                            manipulation of the primary process, the media's
                            relentless attacks on Bernie's "unelectability," the
                            sudden discovery of "superdelegates" by millions of
                            young voters who had never heard the term before—all
                            of it revealed that the system wasn't just biased,
                            it was terrified. Terrified of what might happen if
                            a rainbow coalition actually won.

                            The first Trump term whipped the progressive
                            movement into a fervor unlike anything ever before.
                            I need not recap the four years of unimaginable
                            bullshit we all endured, but suffice to say the left
                            emerged from it knowing exactly what it had to do:
                            come out fucking swinging.

                            2020 was immensely different from 2016. We weren't
                            holding any punches. When the primaries hit, Bernie
                            took off running. He hit Iowa like a tornado, spread
                            across New Hampshire like a wildfire, and sent the
                            talking heads spinning in Nevada. The energy was
                            electric, the organization was tighter, and the
                            coalition was broader than ever before.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I, of course, was there doing my part. I spent the
                            night of the Nevada primary at a vegan taco shop in
                            Vegas surrounded by fellow canvassers, watching the
                            results come in on a grainy projector while we
                            celebrated what felt like unstoppable momentum.
                            Earlier that day we had been trespassing on casino
                            floors, radicalizing workers with knowledge and
                            solidarity. Vegas, to its credit, has a law
                            requiring that casinos allow their workers ample
                            time (and pay) to vote while on the job. The promise
                            of a free afternoon's pay away from kitchen fryers
                            and geriatric Karens certainly won our team some
                            votes. We were building the rainbow coalition right
                            there in the belly of the capitalist beast—hotel
                            workers, kitchen staff, dealers, and cleaners,
                            coming together across racial lines to demand
                            something better.

                        <p>
                            Then, of course, Super Tuesday hit us all like a bag
                            of bricks. The establishment had also learned from
                            2016. They weren't going to let another outsider
                            threaten their grip on power. In a stunningly
                            coordinated display of political theater, every
                            moderate candidate except Biden dropped out within
                            days of each other, consolidating the anti-Bernie
                            vote into a single, unified front. The media, which
                            had been breathlessly covering Bernie's momentum
                            just weeks earlier, suddenly pivoted to declaring
                            his campaign effectively over. The message was
                            clear: the Democratic Party would rather squeak by
                            with an establishment candidate than win big with a
                            socialist.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            You know the rest. Biden won, but barely. Four years
                            later (this time without a primary at all) he shit
                            the bed on stage and America found itself
                            freefalling back into the dark ages.

                            Now in the present, as a far more seasoned
                            progressive and Jew, I find myself fighting a
                            different battle altogether. Had I possessed then
                            the wisdom I now have, this battle would have been
                            less shocking and hurtful to endure. I've come to
                            understand two things with painful clarity thanks to
                            the Bund: what they must have felt watching their
                            dream crumble under the Czar's boot (and later the
                            Soviets'), and—more recently—the nauseating sting of
                            internal betrayal. Like so many others threading the
                            labels of "progressive" and "Jew," I've lost an
                            immense amount of faith over these past several
                            years. It's a wound that, if I'm being honest, might
                            never fully heal.

                            What keeps haunting me are the visceral parallels
                            between the Bund's story and our current moment. I
                            never could have imagined on that night in Vegas,
                            celebrating what felt like unstoppable momentum,
                            that the deepest wounds to be inflicted on my
                            bleeding heart wouldn't come from the MAGA hive-mind
                            (our modern-day Czarist-boot lickers) but from the
                            tired faces within the rainbow coalition itself—now
                            aimed (out of despair, ignorance, prejudice, or some
                            combination of all the above) directly at its Jewish
                            ranks. History's a fucking boomerang, and sooner or
                            later we all get hit.

                            Since October 7th, I have watched former leftist
                            "friends" ration out empathy to Jews as if it were
                            water in the desert. Many have had nothing to spare
                            at all. Progressive peers of mine in America and
                            beyond have instead chained themselves to the myopic
                            dogma of an Islamist fundamentalist death cult
                            masquerading as a legitimate government—one that
                            holds its people hostage to further its draconian
                            ideals, values which represent the antithesis of all
                            that is truly progressive.

                            in vehicles of hate, gassed up with black Qatari

                            not talking about average people who, upon
                            witnessing the horrors of war, have extended
                            unwavering empathy to the Palestinian people—for
                            that is 100% admirable. I am referring to those
                            (disproportionately among leftist echo-chambers) who
                            not only view Palestinian liberation and Israeli
                            self-determination (i.e., Zionism) as antithetical
                            to one another, but who salivate over a tradgedy as

                            gaslighting the Bund faced when their socialist
                            comrades turned on them, the same dismissal Jesse
                            Jackson offered after Hymietown, the same betrayal
                            that echoes through every failed rainbow coalition
                            in history.

                            Mamdani, poised to win tonight's election with a
                            comfortable margin, might be the new heir to
                            democratic socialism in America—perhaps he's even
                            the new face of the Democratic Party. But his
                            coalition ain't a rainbow—it's a monochromatic
                            shit-stain straight out of the history books. Any
                            criticism of Mamdani or the DSA is met with
                            immediate dismissal, as if we who remember the
                            Bund's betrayal, who witnessed the Hymietown
                            scandal, who saw Hampton's coalition crushed, are
                            insane for recognizing the pattern repeating itself.
                            He's not building a rainbow coalition—he's building
                            a coalition that treats Jewish particularity as
                            expendable, just like the Bolsheviks did to the
                            Bund, just like Jackson's allies did after
                            Hymietown.

                        <p>
                            Let's start with the basics. When asked whether
                            Hamas should lay down its arms, Mamdani responded,
                            "<a

                                should lay down arms.</a
                            >" This isn't neutrality—it's moral cowardice of the
                            exact variety that allowed the Bund's socialist
                            comrades to stand by as pogroms unfolded.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Then there are his refusals to condemn phrases like
                            "globalize the intifada" or "from the river to the
                            sea"—both genocidal slogans advocating for a
                            one-state Palestinian solution and globalized
                            violence against Jews. When pressed, he offers
                            half-baked talking points about "anti-imperialist"
                            lenses, but the effect remains the same: Jewish
                            concerns about fanning violent flames are dismissed
                            as "weaponizing" legitimate criticism of Israel.
                            This is the Bund's nightmare realized—the insistence
                            that Jewish particularity must be subsumed under
                            broader class struggle, even when that struggle
                            turns hostile to Jewish existence itself. It's the
                            same rhetorical dance that doomed the Bund when
                            their socialist "allies" decided Jewish concerns
                            were secondary to the revolution.

                            In 2023 Mamdani said the following to cheers in
                            front of a DSA panel: "<a

                            pogroms against the Bund's communities. It's the
                            same conspiratorial thinking that painted Jews as
                            controlling forces behind every oppressive
                            institution, the same logic that ultimately doomed
                            the Bund's cross-ethnic solidarity.

                            and employs the same logic that the Nazis used to

                            universities. It's the Bund's nightmare of

                            He's also spoken of raising an army to "march

                            documented and out in the open. Mamdani chose to

                            willingness to sacrifice Jewish well-being for the
                            sake of ideological purity, the same logic that
                            doomed their rainbow coalition when ethnic hatred

                            dismiss and downplay the voices of the

                            York. The backlash from Jewish organizations has
                            been swift and severe—open letters, petitions,
                            public condemnations—and this isn't about AIPAC or

                            activists who marched for Bernie—people who believed
                            in the rainbow coalition and now feel abandoned by

                            that greeted the Bund when they warned about rising
                            antisemitism, the same dismissal that greeted Jewish
                            concerns after Hymietown, the same pattern that has
                            repeated itself in every failed rainbow coalition
