                                <em>Bär</em>. In Yiddish, umlauts like
                                <em>ä</em> are transliterated to <em>e</em>, so
                                <em>Bär</em> becomes <em>Ber</em>.

                                <br />Oh, bother... Still reading? The Hebrew
                                word for bear is <em>dov</em> (
                                <span dir="rtl">דוב</span>). As a result, you’ll
                                often see both versions used together—take, for
                                example,
                                <em>Dov Ber ben Avraham of Mezeritch</em>, also
                                known as the <em>Maggid of Mezeritch</em>, a
                                disciple of Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, the
                                <s>breaker of chains and mother of dragons</s>
                                founder of Hasidic Judaism.

                                <br />Perhaps I buried the lede. In Judaism,
                                names are upcycled like the timeless graphics on
                                this page. Typically, Ashkenazi (tummy ache)
                                Jews name their children after their most
                                recently
                                <strong>
                                    <em>deceased</em>

                                relative. Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews follow a
                                similar tradition, though they’re a bit less
                                patient. Jewish children who grew up with access
                                to spices must instead earn their namesake
                                through ritual combat with the elderly.
                                Lastly—and to my limited knowledge—Beta Israel
                                (Ethiopian Jews) and other minority communities
                                within the global Jewry follow their own rich
                                naming traditions, of which I am woefully
                                underqualified to detail. Regardless, the
                                purpose of these practices is to preserve the
                                spirit of one’s ancestors and, ideally, embody
                                their best traits.

                                <br />For the most part, this is a lovely
                                tradition. Alas, when your family tree is more
                                of a burning bush, liberties must be taken to
                                prevent overlap. Every schmuck knows a Shlomo,
                                and every nerd knows of Saruman—but tragically
                                Christopher Lee was a goy and not the
                                'penultimate ruler of the Twelve Tribes of
                                Israel.'...
                                <em>One Solomon to rule them all!</em> That’s
                                why Jewish names often take on pet forms. Behrs,
                                Berls, and Beryls—oh my!

                                <br />So how did a Reform diaspora Jew born in
                                1997 (5757 for my fellow
                                <em>Ingregorius Bastards</em>) end up with their
                                third great-grandfather’s name?
                            </p>

                                <br />Traditions—the antithesis of our newly
                                minted "Anthropocene." My father yielded to the
                                pressures of assimilation, breaking a naming
                                tradition our family had upheld for millennia by
                                giving me a more "Americanized" name. Shortly
                                thereafter, I followed suit, breaking with
                                Jewish tradition to instead choose an
                                inheritance for myself. It was my fascination
                                with agriculture that first drew me back to
                                Judaism, unearthing a deeply rooted desire to
                                till the soil and compost the wounds of
                                intergenerational trauma in the process. This
                                journey landed me in a game of ancestral musical
                                chairs—and when the Klezmer ceased, I became the
                                unlikely heir to a 19th-century kibbutznik:
                                someone whose finer traits align almost too
                                perfectly with my deepest desires, a spirit I am
                                proud to preserve.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br />The Ber whose name my Hancock borrows from
                                didn’t inherit the Hasidic movement, though he
                                did grow up next door to the Maggid of Mezeritch
                                in what was known as the Pale of Settlement: a
                                region of the Russian Empire, existing from 1791
                                to 1915, where permanent Jewish settlement was
                                reluctantly tolerated. Here, in a small rural
                                shtetl named Pechora (Ukrainian for "cave"), Ber
                                and his agrarian compatriots milked cows and
                                fiddled on roofs—either until their hearts were
                                content or—far more frequently—until they were
                                forced to flee into the aforementioned caves,
                                hunted by Cossacks for sport.

                                during this period suggests it was a living
                                hell, though what followed would prove far, far
                                worse. In 1908, at the age of 64, Ber and his
                                wife Molly immigrated to Brooklyn to live with
                                their children, who had arrived several years
                                prior to work as tailors—no doubt fleeing the
                                endless pogroms and, I assume, the relentless
                                mosquitoes. My family’s decision to escape the
                                Pale proved wise, as 34 years later, Romania—a
                                member of the Axis powers—would occupy Ukraine
                                and turn Pechora into one of the most infamous
                                sites of the Shoah. The Pechora concentration
                                camp was created "exclusively" for the purpose
                                of killing its prisoners. According to Romanian
                                wartime documentation, a sign that read "death
                                camp" was installed at the main gate, ensuring
                                there would be no misunderstanding among its
                                prisoners. An estimated 11,000 Jews were brought
                                to the Pechora camp, of whom approximately 9,500
                                perished, along with any trace of the old
                                village.
                            </p>

                                <br />One of the few small comforts I find in
                                this tragic story is the knowledge that Ber and
                                Molly were both spared the horror and burden of
                                this period. Ber died in 1918, and Molly
                                followed in 1933. Most of their children, all of
                                whom were born in Pechora, lived through this
                                time—as did all Jews—bearing the full weight of
                                survivor’s guilt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br />Still, despite everything, the legacy of
                                Pechora managed to endure through these dark
                                years. From a world away, the children of a
                                humble agrarian society in the Pale cultivated
                                one of humanity’s finest crops, right in the
                                heart of Brooklyn. Ber and Molly’s son Samuel
                                raised a mensch in Sol, and in turn, Sol and
                                Gertrude—during the height of the Nazis’
                                extermination of Europe’s Jews—rejected
                                humanity’s capacity for evil. Instead, on May
                                30th, 1942, they pulled from the earth my
                                grandfather Steve, the very definition of Jewish
                                joy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br />I’ve had the privilege of visiting Ber and
                                Molly—as well as some of their children—in the
                                Pechora Society of Mt. Judah Cemetery. It is a
                                beautiful time capsule that, especially in the
                                context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, is now
                                all that remains of this slice of the old world.
                                Well, all except for the infinite history
                                embedded in a single, awkwardly spelled Jewish
                                name. <br />

                                <br />Fast forward a century, and the family
                                tailor shop is now a couple of NYU graduating
                                classes away from becoming a Blue Bottle. As for
                                me? I’m a few crashouts away from starting my
                                own shtetl and a bit too queer to join the
                                renfaire over in Crown Heights. So, out of
                                consideration for baristas everywhere, a simple
                                <em>Bear</em> on my coffee cup will suffice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br />When I’m not writing hasbara or
                                controlling the weather, I’m focused on
                                <em>tikkun olam</em>—repairing the world.
                                Academically, I’m tackling soil degradation,
                                with a dream of starting an AgLab dedicated to
                                rain-fed outdoor hydroponics as a supplement to
                                our over-strained and deeply broken monoculture
                                food systems. Professionally, I was once a
                                programmer, but let’s be honest: that industry
                                is beyond repair. My soul needed an escape, and
                                environmental science (later refined to
                                agriculture) became my vice. Still, I’ve kept my
                                knack for digital tinkering, hacking away at
                                projects like this site or an old MacBook 2,1,
                                which has seen more repairs than the Ship of
                                Theseus. I’ve also found a peculiar joy in
                                preservation—data hoarding has become a
                                specialty of mine, with an old LTO6 tape drive
                                tucked in my parents’ closet as I gallivant
                                around the globe. Otherwise, it’s just me, a
                                good sci-fi book, and a cup of black coffee,
                                wherever I go.
