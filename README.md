Good vibrations! You've stumbled upon my corner of the internet, a sort of digital closet for my mental skeletons. There's a lot of odd shit here, so feel free to look around and save anything you like. I frequently update this site with new and exciting cringe, and there's even a blog full of half-baked opinions if you enjoy second-hand psychosis. Otherwise, please enjoy some top-shelf, barrel-aged hypertext with a side of refried GeoCities assets. —Ber ᕦʕ •`ᴥ•´ʔᕤ!
